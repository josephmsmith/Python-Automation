## [Mapping Sea Surface Temps(project)](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Misc/blob/main/Plotting_SST_Data.ipynb)
Mapping Sea Surface Temperatures using data retrieved on NASA website. 

## [read_multiple_local_csvs](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Misc/blob/main/read_multiple_local_csvs.py)
This script takes in a user input of the folder file path containing multiple flat files (specifically CSVs) with the same shape, combines them, and stores them in a single data frame used by pandas.

This script is designed for multiple CSVs without headers and assigns them a numerical value. 

## [pd_df_to_pgadmin](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Misc/blob/main/pd_df_to_pgadmin.py)
This script is used to take in an existing dataframe created in pandas and export it to a new table in an existing database located in pgAdmin. 
This will fail if there are any existing tables with the same name

## [pdf_to_audio](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Automation/blob/main/pdf_to_audio.py)
Need to pick up some new information quickly? Maybe just don't feel like reading a pdf? This Python script reads a PDF file, converts the text from the PDF file into speech using text-to-speech (TTS), and saves the resulting audio file.

## [combine_pdfs](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Automation/blob/main/combine_pdfs.py)
Have a few PDFs you want to combine? Use this script to quickly combine them together. Your reader thanks you in advance... 

## [compress_pdf](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Automation/blob/main/compress_pdf.py)
Lossless Compression. PyPDF2 supports the FlateDecode filter which uses the zlib/deflate compression method. It is a lossless compression, meaning the resulting PDF looks exactly the same. Have fun and save space ðŸ«¡
