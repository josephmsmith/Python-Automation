## [read_multiple_local_csvs](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Misc/blob/main/read_multiple_local_csvs.py)
This script takes in a user input of the folder file path containing multiple flat files (specifically CSVs) with the same shape, combines them, and stores them in a single data frame used by pandas.

This script is designed for multiple CSVs without headers and assigns them a numerical value.
